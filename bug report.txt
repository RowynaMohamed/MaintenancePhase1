Bug Report:

Summary:
The code has a potential division by zero error when calculating the "coordinatePositionsPerMM" variable. 

Description:
The "calculateColumnLocation" method takes a HSSFSheet object, an integer startingColumn, and a double reqImageWidthMM as inputs. 
It calculates the width of the columns starting from the startingColumn until the total width reaches the required image width (reqImageWidthMM). 
It then returns a ClientAnchorDetail object with the starting and ending columns, and an inset value.

However, the method doesn't check whether the "colWidthMM" variable is zero or not before using it to calculate the "coordinatePositionsPerMM" variable.
 If colWidthMM is zero, the division will throw an ArithmeticException.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Call the "calculateColumnLocation" method with a sheet, startingColumn, and reqImageWidthMM values such that the column width for the startingColumn is 
zero.
2. Observe the resulting ArithmeticException.

Expected result:
The method should check whether the "colWidthMM" variable is zero or not before using it in the division to calculate "coordinatePositionsPerMM". 

Suggested solution:
Add an if statement before the division to check whether colWidthMM is zero or not. If it is zero, set coordinatePositionsPerMM to zero or throw an
 exception.

Example fix:
if(colWidthMM == 0){
    coordinatePositionsPerMM = 0;
} else {
    coordinatePositionsPerMM = ConvertImageUnits.TOTAL_COLUMN_COORDINATE_POSITIONS / colWidthMM;
}

Severity:
Minor - This bug may cause an ArithmeticException, but it is not a critical issue that will affect the functionality of the program.
