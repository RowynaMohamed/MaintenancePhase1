Project description:

Creating course and test schedules, maintaining modifications to these schedules, sharing rooms with other events, 
and allocating students to certain classes are all supported by the comprehensive educational scheduling system known as UniTime.
It is a distributed system that enables various university and departmental schedule managers to collaborate in order to create
and change a schedule that satisfies their various organisational needs while minimising student course conflicts. 
It can be interfaced with an existing student information system or used independently to build and maintain a school's class and exam schedule. 
The method was first created in cooperation with academic staff, students, and faculty at universities in North America and Europe. 
The software is provided without charge with an open source licence in an effort that other colleges and universities may find it useful
for better scheduling their students or will want to contribute to ongoing research in this field. 

Techniques used:

To make sure that the UniTime scheduling system satisfies the organization's general aims and objectives, Top-down strategies are utilised for 
making and managing course and exam schedules, sharing spaces with other events, and assigning students to specific classes.
This strategy makes it possible for different schedule managers to work together and modify the schedule while
ensuring that student course conflicts are kept to a minimum.
The class and/or test schedule for a school can be created and maintained using the UniTime scheduling system, which can be interfaced with an existing student
information system or used independently. The scheduling system can be tailored to the unique requirements of the university or department thanks to this degree of flexibility.
In collaboration with academic staff, students, and faculty at institutions in North America and Europe, the UniTime scheduling mechanism was established. Due to the open-source
licence and free software, additional schools and universities can use the scheduling system and contribute to continuing study in the area.

The system's four main partsâ€”Course:
1-Timetabling & Management: 
which is responsible for planning effective schedules and controlling resources, courses, and classrooms. 
It entails creating a schedule that satisfies the requirements of both professors and students while preventing resource and class duplication.

2-Examination Timetabling: 
This function is essential for ensuring that exams are conducted in a fair and organized manner;This includes determining the date, time, and location of
each exam,as well as ensuring there are no conflicts in the schedule for students with multiple exams, and  also responsible for ensuring exam rooms are appropriately allocated.

3-Event Management:
utilised for more than just lessons and exams to schedule different activities in campus spaces.The software generates events for every exam and class
meeting for the academic session. Using the Events interface on the web

4-Student Scheduling:
To ensure that every student's educational needs are addressed, this procedure entails matching the sets of classes that each student needs to the available class seats. 

all function in combination to deliver a full suite of tools for handling challenging scheduling issues in educational institutions.
